## I. INTRODUCTION

### A. Overview of the Project
The CSU Lost and Found System is a web-based platform designed to streamline the process of reporting and recovering lost items within the Caraga State University campus. The system provides a centralized, user-friendly interface for posting and managing lost and found items.

### a. Problem Statement
The current system of posting lost and found items on social media platforms is inefficient and unreliable. Items can easily get buried under other posts, making it difficult for owners to find their lost belongings or for finders to locate the rightful owners.

### b. Objectives of the Study
- Create a dedicated platform for posting and managing lost and found items
- Implement a structured system for item categorization and tracking
- Provide a user-friendly interface for both campus insiders and outsiders
- Establish a transparent process for item claims and returns
- Enable efficient communication between finders and owners

### c. Scope and Limitations
**Scope:**
- Posting and browsing of lost/found items
- Item categorization and filtering
- Image upload support
- Reference number system for tracking
- Admin panel for post management
- Contact form for admin assistance
- History tracking of claimed/returned items

**Limitations:**
- No user authentication system
- No real-time messaging between users
- No automated matching system
- Limited to web platform only

## II. PROJECT BACKGROUND

### a. Description of the Project Domain
The system operates within the Caraga State University campus environment, serving students, faculty, staff, and visitors who may lose or find items on campus.

### b. Current System
Currently, lost and found items are primarily posted on social media platforms like Facebook, which leads to:
- Unstructured posting format
- Difficulty in searching for specific items
- Lack of proper categorization
- No systematic tracking of claims
- Potential privacy concerns

### c. Justification of the Proposed System
The new system provides:
- Structured posting format
- Efficient search and filtering capabilities
- Proper item categorization
- Transparent claim process
- Admin oversight and moderation
- Privacy protection through reference numbers
